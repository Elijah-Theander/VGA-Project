# VGA-Project
Final project/Exam from my HDL Digital design class.

#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to drive a monitor through VGA at a resolution of 800X600.
I have been given code for a base-level design by my professor, and am tasked with modifying it to
accomplish a few tasks.

1) Simple modification of the base Verilog to supply a different result than the given files.

2) A single moving sprite that interacts with boundaries of the screen, up to multiple sprites interacting with one another.

3) Two or more sprites that change in display form through interaction with the user. (Think Pong)
